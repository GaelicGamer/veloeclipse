===========

Veloeclipse is a HTML/XML/JSP/Velocity Editor for Eclipse (Angularjs Support)

Install Instructions:
For Eclipse Mars/NEON (I've just verified that) you to do this (assuming that C:\eclipseMarsEE is root folder of your Eclipse):

Add plugins folder to C:\eclipseMarsEE\dropins so that it looks like: C:\eclipseMarsEE\dropins\plugins
Then add plugin you want to install into that folder: C:\eclipseMarsEE\dropins\plugins\someplugin.jar
Start Eclipse with clean option.
If you are using shortcut on desktop then just right click on Eclipse icon > Properties and in Target field add: -clean like this: C:\eclipseMarsEE\eclipse.exe -clean
enter image description here

Start Eclipse and verify that your plugin works.
Remove -clean option from Target field.
